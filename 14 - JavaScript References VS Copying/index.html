    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lux';
    //console.log(team, players); //both arrays updated to Lux
    //team is a reference to the original array, so updating it also updates the array it's referencing
    //this works differently than when updating references to numbers, strings and booleans as above
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Zoey';
    console.log(team2, players);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Lexie';
    console.log(team3, players);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Wrigley';
    console.log(team4, players);
    
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Lilo';
    console.log(team5, players);
    
    console.clear();
        
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log({person}, {captain}); //person is updated with number: 99 also

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    console.log(cap2, person);
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; //coming soon - not available in JS yet
    
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
